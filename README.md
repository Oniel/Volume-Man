## Description 
VolumeMan is an Android audio management application I created using Android Studio. 

It's a simple application that combines the ideas of Alarms/Timers and Calenders to create an automated audio management system.
In the app, users would be to set a start/end time for a particular audio setting, This audio setting could then be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, or via a custom repeat pattern (just like a Calendar).
The app would have a default audio setting, when an audio setting is not set audio settings would revert to the default.
This app is perfect for those who have various appointments throughout the day where their phone needs to be on slient, vibrate, or very low.  

I worked on this app while I was was studing Computer Science at UNLV. It served as a fun side project as well as a learning experience (this was my first run with mobile development).  
 created the app mainly for myself. I'm forgetful. I'd put my phone on silent while in lecture and always forget to turn the volume back on, or vice versa.  

I sort of abandoned the project as I needed to dedicate my time to other things (I might start working on it again though). 
Anyways my code is up here for everyone. Feel free to dig into it, use it for study material or for your own use.

## Cheers!
